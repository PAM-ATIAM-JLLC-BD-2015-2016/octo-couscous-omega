## ATIAM 2015-2016 Hybrid synthesis project

This repository offers an implementation of two hybrid guitar synthesis
solutions as described in Woodhouse's *On the synthesis of guitar plucks*
paper: an FRF synthesis method and a modal analysis/synthesis process.

Interfaces demonstrating the implementation are available under
`matlab/interfaces`.
